# stress-pc
One script to overload PC (nVidia GPU + MEM + CPU)

Install watch, phoronix-test-suite (https://www.phoronix-test-suite.com/) and unigine-heaven* test, nvidia stuff, memtester, stress-ng, lm-sensors.
It is meant to stress whole PC, not benchmark it. 

* It is probably possible to download Unigine's Heaven standalone (https://benchmark.unigine.com/heaven).
